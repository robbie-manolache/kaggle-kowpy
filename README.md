# Kaggle Kowinski Prize Python Package: `kowpy`

Package designed for the Kowinski Prize competition on Kaggle:
* Analyzes Python code repos using `tree-sitter` (inspired by [aider](https://aider.chat/))
* Deploys open-source LLMs to:
  * Identify which files (and objects within the file) in a repo require\
    modification to address user issues related to the code 
  * Generate fixes for the targeted files/objects
* Contains additional tools to locate specific files/objects in the repo for\
  LLM prompts, configure LLM calls/prompts etc.
